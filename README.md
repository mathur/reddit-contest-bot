reddit-contest-bot
==================

Simple python script for reddit to enter contests for you that follow the format of "comment X on Y post"

Usernames are generated by the `generate_username` python function (currently asks for user input)
Comments are generated by the `generate_comment` python function at the top of the file (currently just comments the username)

## Installation
```
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
If the virtual environment is not already active:
```
. venv/bin/activate
```
then:
```
python app.py <password for generated accounts> <url for the post you want to comment on>
```
Note that you must find the appropriate URL to post on, and you must have permissions to post on that post.

Obviously not responsible for shadowbans/any harm that comes from using this. Recommended to use this script behind a VPN or on a VPS or something with a different IP address than the one you use to mainly browse reddit/for your other accounts.
